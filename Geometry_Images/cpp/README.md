CSC 570 Final Project

Winter 2007, Z. Wood

Details for running the program:

1. Extract the ZIP file to C:/Program Files/GIM/.
2. Drag a mesh into the executable.
3. Make sure that bunny4.bmp and bunnynormals.bmp are in the directory identified by lines
2403 and 2404 in FinalProject.cpp.  If the files are not located in that directory, change
the path to the full location of where they are located and recompile the code.
